Community_Living_BC,"6.4 Conflicts of Interest A conflict of interest is a situation in which the private interests of a Director conflicts directly or indirectly with their responsibilities to CLBC. Community Living BC Board Governance Manual 17 Every Director should avoid any situation in which there is an actual or potential conflict of interest which could, or could be perceived to, interfere with the Director’s judgment in making decisions in CLBC’s best interest. An “apparent conflict of interest” means any situation where it would appear to a reasonable person that a Director is in a conflict of interest situation. 6.4.1 Definitions a) “private interest” means a pecuniary or economic interest or advantage and includes any real or tangible benefit that personally benefits the Director or their associate; b) “associate” means: i. a spouse of the Director; ii. a child of a Director or of the spouse of a Director if the child is under 19 years of age or is living in the family residence; iii. a relative of the Director who is living in the family residence; iv. a friend of the Director; v. a corporation of which the Director beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the voting rights attached to all outstanding voting securities of the corporation; or vi. a trust or estate in which the Director has a substantial beneficial interest or for which the Director serves as trustee; c) “friend” includes an individual with whom the Director is connected by frequent or close association; d) “relative” means a relative by blood, adoption or marriage; and e) “spouse” means a person to whom the Director is married or with whom the Director is living in a marriage-like relationship, including a person of the same gender, but does not include a person from whom the Director is separated or living apart and with whom the Director has entered into an agreement to live apart or who is the subject of an order of a court recognizing the separation. 6.5 Protocols for Dealing with Conflict of Interest Board members who find themselves in an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest must disclose the conflict immediately to the Board Chair and the Governance and Human Resources (GHR) Committee Chair. On at least an annual basis, or as a conflict may arise, all Board members are asked to declare in writing any conflicts of interest they have and offer mitigating strategies which will be evaluated by the GHR Committee. Additional requirements, such as the implementation of screens, may be imposed to meet the Conflict of Interest mitigation standard. In addition, at each committee and board meeting, the meeting’s chair asks the Board members and management to disclose if any item on the agenda could put themselves or any other individual Community Living BC Board Governance Manual 18 present in conflict. Individuals who are in conflict are asked to recuse themselves from that part of the meeting, and if necessary, the Board or GHR Committee Chair follows up to ensure a mitigation strategy is put in place for the future. If a Director is managing a conflict of interest, the Director must refrain from participating in any way except to the extent specifically authorized in the mitigation strategy. The Director may be required to abstain from voting or other actions that impact the outcome of the activity or business transaction, depending on the circumstances and as decided by the Board on the recommendation of the GHR Committee. Full disclosure enables Board members to resolve unclear situations and gives an opportunity to appropriately address conflicting interests before any difficulty can arise."
WorksafeBC,"Conflicts of interest
7. Definitions:
(a) A “real conflict of interest” occurs when a Director has knowledge of a private interest that
is sufficient to influence the exercise of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.
(b) A “potential conflict of interest” occurs when there exists a private interest that could
influence the exercise of a Director’s duty or responsibility, provided that they have not
yet exercised that duty or responsibility.
(c) An “apparent conflict of interest” exists when a reasonably well-informed person could
properly have a reasonable apprehension that a real conflict of interest exists on the
part of a Director.
(d) A “conflict of interest” may be economic or otherwise. A conflict of interest may be either
direct — pertaining to the Director personally — or indirect — pertaining to the Director’s
family, dependants, associates or employer. Under the Workers Compensation Act (Act),
the majority of Directors are nominated by and are representative of various stakeholder
groups and professional associations. As such, it would not be considered an indirect
conflict of interest if the Director advocated on behalf of the constituency they represent,
so long as the Director acts with a view to the best interests and objectives of the
workers’ compensation system as a whole.

WorkSafeBC Board of Directors Manual | January 2024 2
Tab 5: Code of Conduct and Conflict of Interest Guidelines
8. Principles:
(a) It is not sufficient for a Director to act within the law. Directors have an obligation
to act in a manner that will bear the closest public scrutiny.
(b) Therefore, on appointment to office, and thereafter, individual Directors will arrange
their private affairs in a manner that will prevent real, potential or apparent conflicts
of interest from arising. In addition, Directors will disclose in writing any real, potential
or apparent areas of conflict of interest on appointment, as well as at any later date
when new interests or holdings that may give rise to such a conflict are acquired.
(c) If, despite these actions, a conflict arises between the private interests of a Director
and the duties and responsibilities of that Director, the Director is expected to disclose
the conflict and resolve it in favour of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.
9. Disclosure:
(a) When a Director considers that they have a real, potential or apparent conflict of
interest with respect to a particular issue, that Director will declare that conflict before
the Board of Director (BOD) Chair or, in the case of a matter before a BOD Committee,
the Committee Chair prior to any discussion or decision on the issue.
(b) In the case of a conflict of interest, the Director will absent themselves during the
discussion and decision and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in
any way. Upon declaration of a potential conflict, the BOD Chair or Committee Chair
will determine whether the Director should be given the option of participating in the
discussion of the issue.
(c) A Director who identifies a possible real, potential or apparent conflict of interest
on the part of another Director will bring their concern to the other Director’s attention
or to the attention of the BOD Chair or Committee Chair and request that the conflict be
declared. If the other Director refuses to declare the conflict, the Director should inform
the BOD Chair immediately.
(d) In the case of a disagreement about the presence of a real, potential or apparent conflict
of interest, the BOD Chair will determine where such a conflict of interest exists.
(e) In the case of a real, potential or apparent conflict of interest on the part of the BOD
Chair, a majority of the Directors present at the meeting will decide whether such a
conflict of interest exists.
(f) If it is decided that a real, potential or apparent conflict of interest exists on the part
of the BOD Chair, the BOD Chair will designate an acting Chair in accordance with the
BOD Terms of Reference. The BOD Chair will absent themselves during the discussion
and decision on the issue, and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in
any way. The acting Chair may vote on the issue if there is a tie."
Thompson_Rivers_Uni,"PART V - CONFLICT OF DUTY AND INTEREST 1. CONFLICT OF INTEREST DEFINED a. In general, a conflict of interest exists for members of the Board who use their position at the University to benefit themselves, friends or families. b. A member should not use his or her position with the University to pursue or advance the member’s personal interests, the interests of a related person1 , close friend, the member’s business associate, corporation, union or partnership, or the interests of a person to whom the member owes an obligation. c. A Board member should not directly or indirectly benefit from a transaction with the University over which a member can influence decisions made by the University. 1 “related person” means a spouse, child, parent or sibling of a Board Member. Page 45 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:2 d. A Board member should not take personal advantage of an opportunity available to the University unless the University has clearly and irrevocably decided against pursuing the opportunity, and the opportunity is also available to the public. e. A Board member should not use his or her position with the University to solicit clients for the Board member’s business, or a business operated by a close friend, business associate, corporation, union or partnership of the member, or a person to whom the member owes an obligation. f. Every Board member should avoid any situation in which there is, or may appear to be, potential conflict2 which could appear3 to interfere with the member’s judgment in making decisions in the University’s best interest. g. There are several situations that could give rise to a conflict of interest. The most common are accepting gifts, favours or kickbacks from suppliers, close or family relationships with outside suppliers, passing confidential information to competitors or other interested parties or using privileged information inappropriately. The following are examples of the types of conduct and situations that can lead to a conflict of interest: i. influencing the University to lease equipment from a business owned by the Board member’s spouse; ii. influencing the University to allocate funds to an institution where the Board member or his or her relative works or is involved; iii. participating in a decision by the University to hire or promote a relative of the Board member; iv. influencing the University to make all its travel arrangements through a travel agency owned by a relative of the Board member; v. influencing or participating in a decision of the University that will directly or indirectly result in the Board member’s own financial gain. h. A Board member should fully disclose all circumstances that could conceivably be construed as conflict of interest. 2. DISCLOSURE a. Full disclosure enables Board members to resolve unclear situations and gives an opportunity to dispose of conflicting interests before any difficulty can arise. 2 “conflict” means a conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest. 3 “apparent” conflict of interest means any situation where it would appear to a reasonable person that the Board member is in a conflict of interest situation. Page 46 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:3 b. A Board member should, immediately upon becoming aware of a potential conflict of interest situation, disclose the conflict (preferably in writing) to the Board chair. This requirement exists even if the member does not become aware of the conflict until after a transaction is complete. c. If a Board member is in doubt about whether a situation involves a conflict, the member should immediately seek the advice of the Board chair. If appropriate, the board may wish to seek advice from the university’s legal counsel. d. Unless a Board member is otherwise directed, a member should immediately take steps to resolve the conflict or remove the suspicion that it exists. e. If a Board member is concerned that another Board member is in a conflict of interest situation, the member should immediately bring his or her concern to the other member’s attention and request that the conflict be declared. If the other member refuses to declare the conflict, the member should immediately bring his or her concern to the attention of the Board chair. If there is a concern with the Board chair, the issue should be referred to the Executive Committee. f. A Board member should disclose the nature and extent of any conflict at the first meeting of the Board after which the facts leading to the conflict have been brought to that member’s attention. After disclosing the conflict, the member: i) should not take part in the discussion of the matter or vote on any questions in respect of the matter (although the member may be counted in the quorum present at the board meeting); ii) if the meeting is open to the public, may remain in the room, but shall not take part in that portion of the meeting during which the matter giving rise to the conflict is under discussion, and shall leave the room prior to any vote on the matter giving rise to the conflict; iii) should, if the meeting is not open to the public, immediately leave the meeting and not return until all discussion and voting with respect to the matter giving rise to the conflict is completed; and iv) should not attempt, in any way or at any time, to influence the discussion or the voting of the Board on any question relating to the matter giving rise to the conflict. 3. OUTSIDE BUSINESS INTERESTS a. Board members should declare possible conflicting outside business activities at the time of election or appointment. Notwithstanding any outside activities, Board members are required to act in the best interest of the University. Page 47 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:4 b. No Board member should hold a significant financial interest, either directly or through a relative or associate, or hold or accept a position as an officer or director in an organization in a material relationship with the University, where by virtue of his or her position in the University, the member could in any way benefit the other organization by influencing the purchasing, selling or other decisions of the University, unless that interest has been fully disclosed in writing to the University. c. A “significant financial interest” in this context is any interest substantial enough that decisions of the University could result in a personal gain for the Board member. d. Board members who have been selected to the board as a representative of a stakeholder group or region owe the same duties and loyalty to the University and when their duties conflict with the wishes of the stakeholder or constituent, their primary duty remains to act in the best interests of the University. In general, it is not considered a conflict of interest for a member of a broad group (i.e. students, employees, faculty) to vote on matters that will impact that group. However, conflict could reasonably be considered to exist for the following identified groups when considering these matters: i) Discussions and decisions directly affecting a specific instructional program in which: a. a student Board member is enrolled; b. faculty or employee Board members are employed; or c. the Board member has a related person enrolled or employed. ii) Discussions and decisions related to labour negotiations and labour relations: a. for faculty and employee Board members; b. for a Board member with a related person who holds a faculty or employee position at the University; c. for a Board member with a related person who holds a position at another institution who could be seen to gain or benefit from information divulged on these matters. e. For the purpose of clarification, these Bylaws intend that student members are permitted to vote on issues related to tuition and fees. 4. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION a. Confidential information includes proprietary technical, business, financial, legal, or any other information which the University treats as confidential (including all matters discussed at in-camera and committee meetings). Board members should not either during, or Page 48 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:5 following, their term as a Board member, disclose such information to any outside person unless authorized. b. Similarly, Board members should never disclose or use confidential information gained by virtue of their association with the University for personal gain, or to benefit friends, relatives or associates. c. If in doubt about what is considered confidential, a Board member should seek guidance from the Board chair or the President. 5. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT OR ASSOCIATION Board members who accept a position with any organization that could lead to a conflict of interest or situation prejudicial to the University’s interests should discuss the implications of accepting such a position with the Board chair, recognizing that acceptance of such a position might require the member’s resignation from the University’s board. 6. ENTERTAINMENT, GIFTS AND FAVOURS a. It is essential to fair business practices that all those who associate with the University, as suppliers, contractors or directors, have access to the University on equal terms. b. Board members and members of their immediate families should not accept entertainment, gifts or favours that create or appear to create a favoured position for doing business with the organization. Any firm offering such inducements should be asked to cease. c. Similarly, no Board member should offer or solicit gifts or favours in order to secure preferential treatment for themselves or the University. d. Under no circumstances should Board members offer or receive cash, preferred loans, securities, or secret commissions in exchange for preferential treatment. Any Board member experiencing or witnessing such an offer should report the incident to the Board chair immediately. e. Gifts and entertainment should only be accepted or offered by a Board member in the normal exchanges common to established business relationships for the University. An exchange of such gifts should create no sense of obligation on the part of the Board member. f. Inappropriate gifts received by a Board member should be returned to the donor. g. Full and immediate disclosure to the Board chair of borderline cases will always be taken as good-faith compliance with these standards. Page 49 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:6 7. USE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PROPERTY Board members should require the University’s approval to use property owned by the University for personal purposes, or to purchase property from the University unless the purchase is made through the usual channels also available to the public. Even then, a Board member should not purchase property owned by the University if that Board member is involved in an official capacity in some aspect of the sale or purchase. 8. BREACH A Board member found to have breached his or her duty by violating the minimum standards set out in these Bylaws may, by resolution of the Board, be reprimanded or be asked to resign from the Board."
