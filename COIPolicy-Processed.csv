Major Errors:
1. **Omission of Duty to Disclose**: The policy does not explicitly state an individual's duty to disclose any conflicts of interest, which is a critical component of a conflict of interest policy.
2. **Lack of Review Process**: There is no mention of the process for reviewing potential conflicts of interest once they are disclosed. This is necessary to ensure that conflicts are properly assessed and managed.
3. **Disciplinary Actions**: The policy lacks details about the specific disciplinary actions that will be taken if a board member violates the conflict of interest policy.
4. **Annual Disclosure Statement**: There is no mention of a disclosure statement that must be signed by all board members, staff members, and other key personnel each year.
5. **Documentation Requirement**: The policy does not require that the existence and resolution of the conflict of interest be documented in the corporation’s records.
6. **Prohibition Against Influence**: There is no explicit prohibition against any attempt by the person with the conflict to improperly influence the deliberation or voting on the matter related to the conflict.
7. **Related Transactions**: The policy does not include procedures for disclosing, addressing, and documenting related transactions.

Minor Errors:
1. **Clarity in Language**: The phrase ""appropriate action will occur in accordance with CLSMA bylaws"" is vague. It would be beneficial to specify what actions might be taken or provide a reference to where these actions are detailed.
2. **Consistency in Terminology**: The policy should consistently refer to the ""Executive Director"" or any other designated authority to whom conflicts should be disclosed, to avoid confusion.

**Procedure for Managing Conflicts of Interest**

1. **Duty to Disclose Conflicts:**
   - All individuals, including board members, staff members, and other key personnel, must promptly disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest.
   - This disclosure should be made to the Executive Director or the designated authority.
   - The individual must provide detailed information about the conflict, referred to as ""ConflictDetails.""

2. **Review of Disclosed Conflicts:**
   - Upon receiving a disclosure, the Executive Director or designated authority will review the conflict.
   - The review will assess the impact of the conflict and determine appropriate actions to manage or resolve it.
   - The outcome of this review is documented as ""ReviewOutcome.""

3. **Disclosure at Meetings:**
   - If a conflict of interest becomes apparent during a meeting, the individual must disclose it at the beginning of the meeting.
   - This step is conditional and only applies if the conflict is identified during a meeting.
   - The individual must provide ""MeetingDetails"" and receive ""MeetingDisclosureConfirmation.""

4. **Abstention from Participation:**
   - Once a conflict is disclosed, the individual must abstain from participating in any discussion, deliberation, or voting on the matter related to the conflict.
   - This ensures that the individual's conflict does not influence the decision-making process.
   - The abstention is confirmed as ""AbstentionConfirmation.""

5. **Documentation of Conflict:**
   - The Executive Director or designated authority must document the existence and resolution of the conflict in the corporation’s records.
   - This documentation ensures transparency and accountability.
   - The documentation process results in ""DocumentationConfirmation.""

6. **Annual Disclosure Statement:**
   - All board members, staff members, and other key personnel are required to sign an annual disclosure statement.
   - This statement affirms their understanding of and compliance with the conflict of interest policy.
   - The signing of this statement is confirmed as ""AnnualDisclosureConfirmation.""

7. **Enforcement of Disciplinary Actions:**
   - If an individual fails to disclose a conflict of interest or attempts to improperly influence deliberations, disciplinary actions will be enforced.
   - These actions may include removal from the board or termination of employment, as detailed in the CLSMA bylaws.

**Major Errors:**

1. **Definition of Conflict of Interest:** The policy does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes a conflict of interest. This is essential for ensuring that all board members and committee members understand what situations might lead to a conflict.

2. **Disciplinary Actions:** There are no details about disciplinary actions for violating the conflict of interest policy. This is important to ensure compliance and accountability.

3. **Annual Disclosure Statement:** The policy does not mention a requirement for a disclosure statement to be signed by all board members, staff members, and other key personnel each year. This is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability.

4. **Procedures for Related Transactions:** The policy does not include procedures for disclosing, addressing, and documenting related transactions. This is necessary to ensure that all potential conflicts are managed appropriately.

**Minor Errors:**

1. **Ambiguity in Gift Acceptance:** The policy allows for the acceptance of ""modest gifts or hospitality"" but does not define what constitutes ""modest."" Providing a clearer guideline or threshold would help prevent misunderstandings.

2. **Documentation of Resolution:** While the policy states that the disclosure of a conflict of interest and the decision as to whether a conflict exists shall be recorded in the minutes, it does not explicitly state that the resolution of the conflict should also be documented in the corporation’s records. Adding this detail would enhance transparency.

3. **Clarification on Influence Prohibition:** The policy mentions that a Director should not attempt to personally influence the outcome, but it could be clearer by explicitly stating that any attempt to improperly influence deliberation or voting is prohibited.

4. **Scope of Policy:** The policy primarily addresses board members and committee members but does not explicitly mention staff members or other key personnel. Expanding the scope to include these groups would ensure comprehensive coverage."

**Procedure for Conflict of Interest Policy**

1. **Collect Annual Disclosure Statements:**
   - Each year, all board members, staff members, and other key personnel must sign a disclosure statement.
   - This statement affirms their understanding of the conflict of interest policy and requires them to disclose any known conflicts of interest.
   - The DisclosureService will collect these statements from the PersonnelList and output them as DisclosureStatements.

2. **Submit Conflict Disclosures for Review:**
   - Individuals must disclose any potential, real, or perceived conflicts of interest to the President or the Board as soon as they arise.
   - The ConflictReviewService will submit these ConflictDetails for review.
   - The Board will review the disclosures and determine by majority vote if a conflict exists, resulting in a ReviewOutcome.

3. **Enforce Participation Restrictions:**
   - If a conflict of interest is determined to exist (ReviewOutcome.exists), enforce participation restrictions.
   - The ParticipationRestrictionService will ensure that individuals with conflicts:
     - Abstain from participating in discussions or deliberations related to the conflict.
     - Do not attempt to improperly influence the deliberation or voting on the matter.
     - Refrain from voting on the matter.
     - Leave the meeting room during discussions or votes on the matter.
   - The status of these restrictions will be recorded as RestrictionStatus.

4. **Document Conflict Resolution:**
   - The existence, disclosure, and resolution of conflicts of interest must be documented in the corporation’s records, including meeting minutes.
   - The DocumentationService will record these ConflictDetails and output the DocumentationStatus.

5. **Handle Related Transactions:**
   - All related transactions must be disclosed, addressed, and documented to ensure transparency and proper management of potential conflicts.
   - The TransactionDisclosureService will handle these TransactionDetails and output the TransactionDocumentation.

6. **Monitor Gift Acceptance:**
   - Board members, committee members, staff members, and other key personnel must not offer or accept cash payments, gifts, gratuities, privileges, or other personal rewards intended to influence the activities or affairs of Engineers Canada.
   - Modest gifts or hospitality, defined as items or events valued at $100 or less, may be accepted if they do not include cash or negotiable instruments and are disclosed and properly accounted for.
   - The GiftAcceptanceService will monitor these GiftDetails and ensure compliance, outputting the GiftComplianceStatus.

7. **Enforce Disciplinary Actions for Policy Violations:**
   - Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary actions, including removal from the board or committee, termination of employment, or other appropriate measures as determined by the Board.
   - The DisciplinaryActionService will enforce these actions based on ViolationDetails and output the DisciplinaryOutcome."

**Procedure for Managing Conflicts of Interest**

1. **Disclose Conflict of Interest:**
   - Individuals must immediately disclose any actual, potential, or apparent conflict of interest to the Board Chair and the Governance and Human Resources (GHR) Committee Chair.
   - This step involves providing detailed information about the conflict to the ConflictDisclosureService, which will confirm the disclosure.

2. **Sign Annual Disclosure Statement:**
   - All board members, staff members, and key personnel are required to sign an annual disclosure statement.
   - This statement declares any conflicts of interest and is processed through the AnnualDisclosureService, which confirms the signing.

3. **Evaluate Disclosed Conflicts:**
   - The GHR Committee evaluates the disclosed conflicts and any proposed mitigating strategies.
   - This evaluation is conducted by the GHRCommitteeService, which provides results on the evaluation.

4. **Apply Mitigation Strategy:**
   - Based on the evaluation, appropriate mitigation strategies are applied to manage the conflict of interest.
   - Mitigation strategies may include recusal from discussions, divestment of conflicting interests, or other actions, as determined by the MitigationStrategyService.

5. **Recusal from Decision-Making:**
   - Individuals with a conflict must recuse themselves from discussions and decisions related to the conflict.
   - This involves leaving the room during deliberations and abstaining from voting, confirmed by the RecusalService.

6. **Prevent Improper Influence:**
   - Individuals with a conflict are prohibited from attempting to improperly influence the deliberation or voting on the matter.
   - The InfluencePreventionService ensures that no improper influence occurs.

7. **Document Conflict Resolution:**
   - The existence and resolution of the conflict must be documented in the corporation’s records.
   - This documentation is handled by the DocumentationService, which confirms the record-keeping.

8. **Disclose Related Transactions:**
   - Any related transactions must be disclosed, addressed, and documented according to established procedures.
   - The TransactionDisclosureService manages this process and confirms the disclosure.

9. **Enforce Disciplinary Actions:**
   - Violations of the conflict of interest policy may result in disciplinary actions, including removal from the board or termination of employment.
   - The DisciplinaryActionService enforces these actions based on the severity of the violation.

10. **Ensure Full Disclosure:**
    - Full disclosure is essential to resolve unclear situations and address conflicting interests effectively.
    - The FullDisclosureService ensures that all necessary disclosures are made and confirmed.

By following these steps, Community Living BC ensures that all decisions are made in the best interest of the organization, free from undue influence or personal gain."

Conflicts of interest
7. Definitions:
(a) A “real conflict of interest” occurs when a Director has knowledge of a private interest that
is sufficient to influence the exercise of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.
(b) A “potential conflict of interest” occurs when there exists a private interest that could
influence the exercise of a Director’s duty or responsibility, provided that they have not
yet exercised that duty or responsibility.
(c) An “apparent conflict of interest” exists when a reasonably well-informed person could
properly have a reasonable apprehension that a real conflict of interest exists on the
part of a Director.
(d) A “conflict of interest” may be economic or otherwise. A conflict of interest may be either
direct — pertaining to the Director personally — or indirect — pertaining to the Director’s
family, dependants, associates or employer. Under the Workers Compensation Act (Act),
the majority of Directors are nominated by and are representative of various stakeholder
groups and professional associations. As such, it would not be considered an indirect
conflict of interest if the Director advocated on behalf of the constituency they represent,
so long as the Director acts with a view to the best interests and objectives of the
workers’ compensation system as a whole.

WorkSafeBC Board of Directors Manual | January 2024 2
Tab 5: Code of Conduct and Conflict of Interest Guidelines
8. Principles:
(a) It is not sufficient for a Director to act within the law. Directors have an obligation
to act in a manner that will bear the closest public scrutiny.
(b) Therefore, on appointment to office, and thereafter, individual Directors will arrange
their private affairs in a manner that will prevent real, potential or apparent conflicts
of interest from arising. In addition, Directors will disclose in writing any real, potential
or apparent areas of conflict of interest on appointment, as well as at any later date
when new interests or holdings that may give rise to such a conflict are acquired.
(c) If, despite these actions, a conflict arises between the private interests of a Director
and the duties and responsibilities of that Director, the Director is expected to disclose
the conflict and resolve it in favour of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.
9. Disclosure:
(a) When a Director considers that they have a real, potential or apparent conflict of
interest with respect to a particular issue, that Director will declare that conflict before
the Board of Director (BOD) Chair or, in the case of a matter before a BOD Committee,
the Committee Chair prior to any discussion or decision on the issue.
(b) In the case of a conflict of interest, the Director will absent themselves during the
discussion and decision and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in
any way. Upon declaration of a potential conflict, the BOD Chair or Committee Chair
will determine whether the Director should be given the option of participating in the
discussion of the issue.
(c) A Director who identifies a possible real, potential or apparent conflict of interest
on the part of another Director will bring their concern to the other Director’s attention
or to the attention of the BOD Chair or Committee Chair and request that the conflict be
declared. If the other Director refuses to declare the conflict, the Director should inform
the BOD Chair immediately.
(d) In the case of a disagreement about the presence of a real, potential or apparent conflict
of interest, the BOD Chair will determine where such a conflict of interest exists.
(e) In the case of a real, potential or apparent conflict of interest on the part of the BOD
Chair, a majority of the Directors present at the meeting will decide whether such a
conflict of interest exists.
(f) If it is decided that a real, potential or apparent conflict of interest exists on the part
of the BOD Chair, the BOD Chair will designate an acting Chair in accordance with the
BOD Terms of Reference. The BOD Chair will absent themselves during the discussion
and decision on the issue, and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in
any way. The acting Chair may vote on the issue if there is a tie."

**Revised Conflict of Interest Policy**

**7. Definitions:**
(a) A “real conflict of interest” occurs when a Director has knowledge of a private interest that is sufficient to influence the exercise of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.
(b) A “potential conflict of interest” occurs when there exists a private interest that could influence the exercise of a Director’s duty or responsibility, provided that they have not yet exercised that duty or responsibility.
(c) An “apparent conflict of interest” exists when a reasonably well-informed person could properly have a reasonable apprehension that a real conflict of interest exists on the part of a Director.
(d) A “conflict of interest” may be economic or otherwise. A conflict of interest may be either direct — pertaining to the Director personally — or indirect — pertaining to the Director’s family, dependants, associates, or employer. Under the Workers Compensation Act (Act), the majority of Directors are nominated by and are representative of various stakeholder groups and professional associations. As such, it would not be considered an indirect conflict of interest if the Director advocated on behalf of the constituency they represent, so long as the Director acts with a view to the best interests and objectives of the workers’ compensation system as a whole.

**8. Principles:**
(a) Directors have an obligation to act in a manner that will withstand the highest standards of ethical conduct and public scrutiny, beyond merely acting within the law.
(b) Upon appointment to office, and annually thereafter, individual Directors will arrange their private affairs in a manner that will prevent real, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest from arising. Directors will disclose in writing any real, potential, or apparent areas of conflict of interest upon appointment, as well as at any later date when new interests or holdings that may give rise to such a conflict are acquired.
(c) If a conflict arises between the private interests of a Director and the duties and responsibilities of that Director, the Director is expected to disclose the conflict and resolve it in favor of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.

**9. Disclosure and Review Process:**
(a) Directors have a duty to disclose any real, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to a particular issue. This disclosure must be made to the Board of Directors Chair or, in the case of a matter before a Board Committee, the Committee Chair prior to any discussion or decision on the issue.
(b) In the case of a conflict of interest, the Director will absent themselves during the discussion and decision and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in any way. The Board of Directors Chair or Committee Chair will determine whether the Director should be given the option of participating in the discussion of the issue, only if it is determined that the conflict is not substantial.
(c) A Director who identifies a possible real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest on the part of another Director will bring their concern to the other Director’s attention or to the attention of the Board of Directors Chair or Committee Chair and request that the conflict be declared. If the other Director refuses to declare the conflict, the Director should inform the Board of Directors Chair immediately.
(d) In the case of a disagreement about the presence of a real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest, the Board of Directors Chair will determine whether such a conflict of interest exists.
(e) In the case of a real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest on the part of the Board of Directors Chair, a majority of the Directors present at the meeting will decide whether such a conflict of interest exists.
(f) If it is decided that a real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest exists on the part of the Board of Directors Chair, the Board of Directors Chair will designate an acting Chair in accordance with the Board of Directors Terms of Reference. The Board of Directors Chair will absent themselves during the discussion and decision on the issue and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in any way. The acting Chair may vote on the issue if there is a tie, exercising the same authority as the Board of Directors Chair.

**10. Documentation and Annual Disclosure:**
(a) The existence and resolution of any conflict of interest must be documented in the corporation’s records.
(b) All board members, staff members, and other key personnel are required to sign an annual disclosure statement acknowledging their understanding of and compliance with this policy.

**11. Disciplinary Actions:**
(a) Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary actions, up to and including removal from the Board or termination of employment, depending on the severity of the violation.

**12. Related Transactions:**
(a) Procedures for disclosing, addressing, and documenting related transactions will be established to ensure transparency and accountability in all dealings.

This revised policy addresses the major and minor errors identified, ensuring clarity, comprehensiveness, and adherence to best practices in conflict of interest management."

**Revised Conflict of Interest Policy**

**7. Definitions:**
(a) A “real conflict of interest” occurs when a Director has knowledge of a private interest that is sufficient to influence the exercise of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.
(b) A “potential conflict of interest” occurs when there exists a private interest that could influence the exercise of a Director’s duty or responsibility, provided that they have not yet exercised that duty or responsibility.
(c) An “apparent conflict of interest” exists when a reasonably well-informed person could properly have a reasonable apprehension that a real conflict of interest exists on the part of a Director.
(d) A “conflict of interest” may be economic or otherwise. A conflict of interest may be either direct — pertaining to the Director personally — or indirect — pertaining to the Director’s family, dependants, associates, or employer. Under the Workers Compensation Act (Act), the majority of Directors are nominated by and are representative of various stakeholder groups and professional associations. As such, it would not be considered an indirect conflict of interest if the Director advocated on behalf of the constituency they represent, so long as the Director acts with a view to the best interests and objectives of the workers’ compensation system as a whole.

**8. Principles:**
(a) Directors have an obligation to act in a manner that will withstand the highest standards of ethical conduct and public scrutiny, beyond merely acting within the law.
(b) Upon appointment to office, and annually thereafter, individual Directors will arrange their private affairs in a manner that will prevent real, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest from arising. Directors will disclose in writing any real, potential, or apparent areas of conflict of interest upon appointment, as well as at any later date when new interests or holdings that may give rise to such a conflict are acquired.
(c) If a conflict arises between the private interests of a Director and the duties and responsibilities of that Director, the Director is expected to disclose the conflict and resolve it in favor of their duties and responsibilities as a Director.

**9. Disclosure and Review Process:**
(a) Directors have a duty to disclose any real, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to a particular issue. This disclosure must be made to the Board of Directors Chair or, in the case of a matter before a Board Committee, the Committee Chair prior to any discussion or decision on the issue.
(b) In the case of a conflict of interest, the Director will absent themselves during the discussion and decision and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in any way. The Board of Directors Chair or Committee Chair will determine whether the Director should be given the option of participating in the discussion of the issue, only if it is determined that the conflict is not substantial.
(c) A Director who identifies a possible real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest on the part of another Director will bring their concern to the other Director’s attention or to the attention of the Board of Directors Chair or Committee Chair and request that the conflict be declared. If the other Director refuses to declare the conflict, the Director should inform the Board of Directors Chair immediately.
(d) In the case of a disagreement about the presence of a real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest, the Board of Directors Chair will determine whether such a conflict of interest exists.
(e) In the case of a real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest on the part of the Board of Directors Chair, a majority of the Directors present at the meeting will decide whether such a conflict of interest exists.
(f) If it is decided that a real, potential, or apparent conflict of interest exists on the part of the Board of Directors Chair, the Board of Directors Chair will designate an acting Chair in accordance with the Board of Directors Terms of Reference. The Board of Directors Chair will absent themselves during the discussion and decision on the issue and not attempt to influence the discussion or decision in any way. The acting Chair may vote on the issue if there is a tie, exercising the same authority as the Board of Directors Chair.

**10. Documentation and Annual Disclosure:**
(a) The existence and resolution of any conflict of interest must be documented in the corporation’s records.
(b) All board members, staff members, and other key personnel are required to sign an annual disclosure statement acknowledging their understanding of and compliance with this policy.

**11. Disciplinary Actions:**
(a) Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary actions, up to and including removal from the Board or termination of employment, depending on the severity of the violation.

**12. Related Transactions:**
(a) Procedures for disclosing, addressing, and documenting related transactions will be established to ensure transparency and accountability in all dealings.

This revised policy addresses the major and minor errors identified, ensuring clarity, comprehensiveness, and adherence to best practices in conflict of interest management."

PART V - CONFLICT OF DUTY AND INTEREST 1. CONFLICT OF INTEREST DEFINED a. In general, a conflict of interest exists for members of the Board who use their position at the University to benefit themselves, friends or families. b. A member should not use his or her position with the University to pursue or advance the member’s personal interests, the interests of a related person1 , close friend, the member’s business associate, corporation, union or partnership, or the interests of a person to whom the member owes an obligation. c. A Board member should not directly or indirectly benefit from a transaction with the University over which a member can influence decisions made by the University. 1 “related person” means a spouse, child, parent or sibling of a Board Member. Page 45 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:2 d. A Board member should not take personal advantage of an opportunity available to the University unless the University has clearly and irrevocably decided against pursuing the opportunity, and the opportunity is also available to the public. e. A Board member should not use his or her position with the University to solicit clients for the Board member’s business, or a business operated by a close friend, business associate, corporation, union or partnership of the member, or a person to whom the member owes an obligation. f. Every Board member should avoid any situation in which there is, or may appear to be, potential conflict2 which could appear3 to interfere with the member’s judgment in making decisions in the University’s best interest. g. There are several situations that could give rise to a conflict of interest. The most common are accepting gifts, favours or kickbacks from suppliers, close or family relationships with outside suppliers, passing confidential information to competitors or other interested parties or using privileged information inappropriately. The following are examples of the types of conduct and situations that can lead to a conflict of interest: i. influencing the University to lease equipment from a business owned by the Board member’s spouse; ii. influencing the University to allocate funds to an institution where the Board member or his or her relative works or is involved; iii. participating in a decision by the University to hire or promote a relative of the Board member; iv. influencing the University to make all its travel arrangements through a travel agency owned by a relative of the Board member; v. influencing or participating in a decision of the University that will directly or indirectly result in the Board member’s own financial gain. h. A Board member should fully disclose all circumstances that could conceivably be construed as conflict of interest. 2. DISCLOSURE a. Full disclosure enables Board members to resolve unclear situations and gives an opportunity to dispose of conflicting interests before any difficulty can arise. 2 “conflict” means a conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest. 3 “apparent” conflict of interest means any situation where it would appear to a reasonable person that the Board member is in a conflict of interest situation. Page 46 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:3 b. A Board member should, immediately upon becoming aware of a potential conflict of interest situation, disclose the conflict (preferably in writing) to the Board chair. This requirement exists even if the member does not become aware of the conflict until after a transaction is complete. c. If a Board member is in doubt about whether a situation involves a conflict, the member should immediately seek the advice of the Board chair. If appropriate, the board may wish to seek advice from the university’s legal counsel. d. Unless a Board member is otherwise directed, a member should immediately take steps to resolve the conflict or remove the suspicion that it exists. e. If a Board member is concerned that another Board member is in a conflict of interest situation, the member should immediately bring his or her concern to the other member’s attention and request that the conflict be declared. If the other member refuses to declare the conflict, the member should immediately bring his or her concern to the attention of the Board chair. If there is a concern with the Board chair, the issue should be referred to the Executive Committee. f. A Board member should disclose the nature and extent of any conflict at the first meeting of the Board after which the facts leading to the conflict have been brought to that member’s attention. After disclosing the conflict, the member: i) should not take part in the discussion of the matter or vote on any questions in respect of the matter (although the member may be counted in the quorum present at the board meeting); ii) if the meeting is open to the public, may remain in the room, but shall not take part in that portion of the meeting during which the matter giving rise to the conflict is under discussion, and shall leave the room prior to any vote on the matter giving rise to the conflict; iii) should, if the meeting is not open to the public, immediately leave the meeting and not return until all discussion and voting with respect to the matter giving rise to the conflict is completed; and iv) should not attempt, in any way or at any time, to influence the discussion or the voting of the Board on any question relating to the matter giving rise to the conflict. 3. OUTSIDE BUSINESS INTERESTS a. Board members should declare possible conflicting outside business activities at the time of election or appointment. Notwithstanding any outside activities, Board members are required to act in the best interest of the University. Page 47 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:4 b. No Board member should hold a significant financial interest, either directly or through a relative or associate, or hold or accept a position as an officer or director in an organization in a material relationship with the University, where by virtue of his or her position in the University, the member could in any way benefit the other organization by influencing the purchasing, selling or other decisions of the University, unless that interest has been fully disclosed in writing to the University. c.

Board members who have been selected to the board as a representative of a stakeholder group or region owe the same duties and loyalty to the University and when their duties conflict with the wishes of the stakeholder or constituent, their primary duty remains to act in the best interests of the University. In general, it is not considered a conflict of interest for a member of a broad group (i.e. students, employees, faculty) to vote on matters that will impact that group. However, conflict could reasonably be considered to exist for the following identified groups when considering these matters: i) Discussions and decisions directly affecting a specific instructional program in which: a. a student Board member is enrolled; b. faculty or employee Board members are employed; or c. the Board member has a related person enrolled or employed. ii) Discussions and decisions related to labour negotiations and labour relations: a. for faculty and employee Board members; b. for a Board member with a related person who holds a faculty or employee position at the University; c. for a Board member with a related person who holds a position at another institution who could be seen to gain or benefit from information divulged on these matters. e. For the purpose of clarification, these Bylaws intend that student members are permitted to vote on issues related to tuition and fees. 4. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION a.

OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT OR ASSOCIATION Board members who accept a position with any organization that could lead to a conflict of interest or situation prejudicial to the University’s interests should discuss the implications of accepting such a position with the Board chair, recognizing that acceptance of such a position might require the member’s resignation from the University’s board. 6.

You are a checker of policy and procedures. You look for errors and omissions. 

Here are some of the details you should include in a conflict of interest policy:
	A statement about an individual’s duty to disclose any conflicts of interest
	The process for reviewing potential conflicts of interest
	Details about disciplinary actions for violating the policy
	A disclosure statement that’s signed by all board members, staff members, and other key personnel each year

PART V - CONFLICT OF DUTY AND INTEREST 1. CONFLICT OF INTEREST DEFINED a. In general, a conflict of interest exists for members of the Board who use their position at the University to benefit themselves, friends or families. b. A member should not use his or her position with the University to pursue or advance the member’s personal interests, the interests of a related person1 , close friend, the member’s business associate, corporation, union or partnership, or the interests of a person to whom the member owes an obligation. c. A Board member should not directly or indirectly benefit from a transaction with the University over which a member can influence decisions made by the University. 1 “related person” means a spouse, child, parent or sibling of a Board Member. Page 45 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:2 d. A Board member should not take personal advantage of an opportunity available to the University unless the University has clearly and irrevocably decided against pursuing the opportunity, and the opportunity is also available to the public. e. A Board member should not use his or her position with the University to solicit clients for the Board member’s business, or a business operated by a close friend, business associate, corporation, union or partnership of the member, or a person to whom the member owes an obligation. f. Every Board member should avoid any situation in which there is, or may appear to be, potential conflict2 which could appear3 to interfere with the member’s judgment in making decisions in the University’s best interest. g. There are several situations that could give rise to a conflict of interest. The most common are accepting gifts, favours or kickbacks from suppliers, close or family relationships with outside suppliers, passing confidential information to competitors or other interested parties or using privileged information inappropriately. The following are examples of the types of conduct and situations that can lead to a conflict of interest: i. influencing the University to lease equipment from a business owned by the Board member’s spouse; ii. influencing the University to allocate funds to an institution where the Board member or his or her relative works or is involved; iii. participating in a decision by the University to hire or promote a relative of the Board member; iv. influencing the University to make all its travel arrangements through a travel agency owned by a relative of the Board member; v. influencing or participating in a decision of the University that will directly or indirectly result in the Board member’s own financial gain. h. A Board member should fully disclose all circumstances that could conceivably be construed as conflict of interest. 2. DISCLOSURE a. Full disclosure enables Board members to resolve unclear situations and gives an opportunity to dispose of conflicting interests before any difficulty can arise. 2 “conflict” means a conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest. 3 “apparent” conflict of interest means any situation where it would appear to a reasonable person that the Board member is in a conflict of interest situation. Page 46 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:3 b. A Board member should, immediately upon becoming aware of a potential conflict of interest situation, disclose the conflict (preferably in writing) to the Board chair. This requirement exists even if the member does not become aware of the conflict until after a transaction is complete. c. If a Board member is in doubt about whether a situation involves a conflict, the member should immediately seek the advice of the Board chair. If appropriate, the board may wish to seek advice from the university’s legal counsel. d. Unless a Board member is otherwise directed, a member should immediately take steps to resolve the conflict or remove the suspicion that it exists. e. If a Board member is concerned that another Board member is in a conflict of interest situation, the member should immediately bring his or her concern to the other member’s attention and request that the conflict be declared. If the other member refuses to declare the conflict, the member should immediately bring his or her concern to the attention of the Board chair. If there is a concern with the Board chair, the issue should be referred to the Executive Committee. f. A Board member should disclose the nature and extent of any conflict at the first meeting of the Board after which the facts leading to the conflict have been brought to that member’s attention. After disclosing the conflict, the member: i) should not take part in the discussion of the matter or vote on any questions in respect of the matter (although the member may be counted in the quorum present at the board meeting); ii) if the meeting is open to the public, may remain in the room, but shall not take part in that portion of the meeting during which the matter giving rise to the conflict is under discussion, and shall leave the room prior to any vote on the matter giving rise to the conflict; iii) should, if the meeting is not open to the public, immediately leave the meeting and not return until all discussion and voting with respect to the matter giving rise to the conflict is completed; and iv) should not attempt, in any way or at any time, to influence the discussion or the voting of the Board on any question relating to the matter giving rise to the conflict. 3. OUTSIDE BUSINESS INTERESTS a. Board members should declare possible conflicting outside business activities at the time of election or appointment. Notwithstanding any outside activities, Board members are required to act in the best interest of the University. Page 47 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:4 b. No Board member should hold a significant financial interest, either directly or through a relative or associate, or hold or accept a position as an officer or director in an organization in a material relationship with the University, where by virtue of his or her position in the University, the member could in any way benefit the other organization by influencing the purchasing, selling or other decisions of the University, unless that interest has been fully disclosed in writing to the University. c. A “significant financial interest” in this context is any interest substantial enough that decisions of the University could result in a personal gain for the Board member. d. Board members who have been selected to the board as a representative of a stakeholder group or region owe the same duties and loyalty to the University and when their duties conflict with the wishes of the stakeholder or constituent, their primary duty remains to act in the best interests of the University. In general, it is not considered a conflict of interest for a member of a broad group (i.e. students, employees, faculty) to vote on matters that will impact that group.

For the purpose of clarification, these Bylaws intend that student members are permitted to vote on issues related to tuition and fees. 4. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION a. Confidential information includes proprietary technical, business, financial, legal, or any other information which the University treats as confidential (including all matters discussed at in-camera and committee meetings). Board members should not either during, or Page 48 of 73 BOARD MANUAL Code of Conduct Approved: September 28, 2012 Revised: May 29, 2015 Page 14:5 following, their term as a Board member, disclose such information to any outside person unless authorized. b. Similarly, Board members should never disclose or use confidential information gained by virtue of their association with the University for personal gain, or to benefit friends, relatives or associates. c. If in doubt about what is considered confidential, a Board member should seek guidance from the Board chair or the President. 5. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT OR ASSOCIATION Board members who accept a position with any organization that could lead to a conflict of interest or situation prejudicial to the University’s interests should discuss the implications of accepting such a position with the Board chair, recognizing that acceptance of such a position might require the member’s resignation from the University’s board. 6. ENTERTAINMENT, GIFTS AND FAVOURS a. It is essential to fair business practices that all those who associate with the University, as suppliers, contractors or directors, have access to the University on equal terms. b. Board members and members of their immediate families should not accept entertainment, gifts or favours that create or appear to create a favoured position for doing business with the organization. Any firm offering such inducements should be asked to cease. c. Similarly, no Board member should offer or solicit gifts or favours in order to secure preferential treatment for themselves or the University. d. Under no circumstances should Board members offer or receive cash, preferred loans, securities, or secret commissions in exchange for preferential treatment. Any Board member experiencing or witnessing such an offer should report the incident to the Board chair immediately. e. Gifts and entertainment should only be accepted or offered by a Board member in the normal exchanges common to established business relationships for the University. An exchange of such gifts should create no sense of obligation on the part of the Board member. f. Inappropriate gifts received by a Board member should be returned to the donor. g. Full and immediate disclosure to the Board chair of borderline cases will always be taken as good-faith compliance with these standards.

**PART V - CONFLICT OF DUTY AND INTEREST**

1. **CONFLICT OF INTEREST DEFINED**

   a. In general, a conflict of interest exists for members of the Board who use their position at the University to benefit themselves, friends, or families.

   b. A member must not use his or her position with the University to pursue or advance the member’s personal interests, the interests of a related person, close friend, the member’s business associate, corporation, union, or partnership, or the interests of a person to whom the member owes an obligation.

   c. A Board member must not directly or indirectly benefit from a transaction with the University over which a member can influence decisions made by the University.

   d. A Board member must not take personal advantage of an opportunity available to the University unless the University has clearly and irrevocably decided against pursuing the opportunity, and the opportunity is also available to the public.

   e. A Board member must not use his or her position with the University to solicit clients for the Board member’s business, or a business operated by a close friend, business associate, corporation, union, or partnership of the member, or a person to whom the member owes an obligation.

   f. Every Board member must avoid any situation in which there is, or may appear to be, a potential conflict of interest which could interfere with the member’s judgment in making decisions in the University’s best interest.

   g. There are several situations that could give rise to a conflict of interest. The most common are accepting gifts, favors, or kickbacks from suppliers, close or family relationships with outside suppliers, passing confidential information to competitors or other interested parties, or using privileged information inappropriately. Examples include:

      i. Influencing the University to lease equipment from a business owned by the Board member’s spouse.

      ii. Influencing the University to allocate funds to an institution where the Board member or his or her relative works or is involved.

      iii. Participating in a decision by the University to hire or promote a relative of the Board member.

      iv. Influencing the University to make all its travel arrangements through a travel agency owned by a relative of the Board member.

      v. Influencing or participating in a decision of the University that will directly or indirectly result in the Board member’s own financial gain.

   h. A Board member must fully disclose all circumstances that could conceivably be construed as a conflict of interest.

2. **DISCLOSURE**

   a. Full disclosure enables Board members to resolve unclear situations and gives an opportunity to dispose of conflicting interests before any difficulty can arise.

   b. A Board member must, within 24 hours of becoming aware of a potential conflict of interest situation, disclose the conflict in writing to the Board chair. This requirement exists even if the member does not become aware of the conflict until after a transaction is complete.

   c. If a Board member is in doubt about whether a situation involves a conflict, the member must immediately seek the advice of the Board chair. If appropriate, the board may wish to seek advice from the university’s legal counsel.

   d. Unless a Board member is otherwise directed, a member must immediately take steps to resolve the conflict or remove the suspicion that it exists.

   e. If a Board member is concerned that another Board member is in a conflict of interest situation, the member must immediately bring his or her concern to the other member’s attention and request that the conflict be declared. If the other member refuses to declare the conflict, the member must immediately bring his or her concern to the attention of the Board chair. If there is a concern with the Board chair, the issue should be referred to the Executive Committee.

   f. A Board member must disclose the nature and extent of any conflict at the first meeting of the Board after which the facts leading to the conflict have been brought to that member’s attention. After disclosing the conflict, the member must not be present during discussions or voting on the matter, regardless of whether the meeting is public or private, and must not attempt to influence the discussion or voting.

3. **OUTSIDE BUSINESS INTERESTS**

   a. Board members must declare possible conflicting outside business activities at the time of election or appointment. Notwithstanding any outside activities, Board members are required to act in the best interest of the University.

   b. No Board member should hold a significant financial interest, either directly or through a relative or associate, or hold or accept a position as an officer or director in an organization in a material relationship with the University, where by virtue of his or her position in the University, the member could in any way benefit the other organization by influencing the purchasing, selling, or other decisions of the University, unless that interest has been fully disclosed in writing to the University.

   c. A “significant financial interest” in this context is any interest substantial enough that decisions of the University could result in a personal gain for the Board member. For example, ownership of more than 5% of a company’s stock or receiving more than $10,000 in compensation from a company.

   d. Board members who have been selected to the board as a representative of a stakeholder group or region owe the same duties and loyalty to the University and when their duties conflict with the wishes of the stakeholder or constituent, their primary duty remains to act in the best interests of the University. In general, it is not considered a conflict of interest for a member of a broad group (i.e. students, employees, faculty) to vote on matters that will impact that group. However, conflict could reasonably be considered to exist for the following identified groups when considering these matters:

      i) Discussions and decisions directly affecting a specific instructional program in which:

         a. a student Board member is enrolled;

         b. faculty or employee Board members are employed; or

         c. the Board member has a related person enrolled or employed.

      ii) Discussions and decisions related to labor negotiations and labor relations:

         a. for faculty and employee Board members;

         b. for a Board member with a related person who holds a faculty or employee position at the University;

         c. for a Board member with a related person who holds a position at another institution who could be seen to gain or benefit from information divulged on these matters.

   e. For the purpose of clarification, these Bylaws intend that student members are permitted to vote on issues related to tuition and fees.

4. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**

   a. Confidential information includes proprietary technical, business, financial, legal, or any other information which the University treats as confidential (including all matters discussed at in-camera and committee meetings). Board members must not, either during or following their term as a Board member, disclose such information to any outside person unless authorized.

   b. Similarly, Board members must never disclose or use confidential information gained by virtue of their association with the University for personal gain, or to benefit friends, relatives, or associates.

   c. If in doubt about what is considered confidential, a Board member must seek guidance from the Board chair or the President.

5. **OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT OR ASSOCIATION**

   Board members who accept a position with any organization that could lead to a conflict of interest or situation prejudicial to the University’s interests must discuss the implications of accepting such a position with the Board chair, recognizing that acceptance of such a position might require the member’s resignation from the University’s board.

6. **ENTERTAINMENT, GIFTS, AND FAVORS**

   a. It is essential to fair business practices that all those who associate with the University, as suppliers, contractors, or directors, have access to the University on equal terms.

   b. Board members and members of their immediate families must not accept entertainment, gifts, or favors that create or appear to create a favored position for doing business with the organization. Any firm offering such inducements should be asked to cease.

   c. Similarly, no Board member should offer or solicit gifts or favors in order to secure preferential treatment for themselves or the University.

   d. Under no circumstances should Board members offer or receive cash, preferred loans, securities, or secret commissions in exchange for preferential treatment. Any Board member experiencing or witnessing such an offer must report the incident to the Board chair immediately.

   e. Gifts and entertainment should only be accepted or offered by a Board member in the normal exchanges common to established business relationships for the University, such as a business lunch or promotional items of nominal value. An exchange of such gifts should create no sense of obligation on the part of the Board member.

   f. Inappropriate gifts received by a Board member should be returned to the donor.

   g. Full and immediate disclosure to the Board chair of borderline cases will always be taken as good-faith compliance with these standards.

7. **USE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PROPERTY**

   Board members must require the University’s approval to use property owned by the University for personal purposes, or to purchase property from the University unless the purchase is made through the usual channels also available to the public. Even then, a Board member must not purchase property owned by the University if that Board member is involved in an official capacity in some aspect of the sale or purchase.

8. **BREACH**

   A Board member found to have breached his or her duty by violating the minimum standards set out in these Bylaws may, by resolution of the Board, be reprimanded, suspended, or be asked to resign from the Board. In severe cases, legal action may be pursued.

9. **ANNUAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT**

   All board members, staff members, and other key personnel must sign an annual disclosure statement affirming that they have read and understood the conflict of interest policy and have disclosed any potential conflicts.

10. **REVIEW PROCESS**

    Upon disclosure of a potential conflict of interest, the Board chair, in consultation with legal counsel if necessary, will review the situation and determine the appropriate course of action. The resolution of the conflict must be documented in the corporation’s records.

11. **RELATED TRANSACTIONS**

    Procedures for disclosing, addressing, and documenting related transactions must be followed to ensure transparency and accountability. All related transactions must be reviewed and approved by the Board to ensure they are conducted at arm’s length and in the best interest of the University."

A member must not use his or her position with the University to pursue or advance the member’s personal interests, the interests of a related person, close friend, the member’s business associate, corporation, union, or partnership, or the interests of a person to whom the member owes an obligation.

   c. A Board member must not directly or indirectly benefit from a transaction with the University over which a member can influence decisions made by the University.

   d. A Board member must not take personal advantage of an opportunity available to the University unless the University has clearly and irrevocably decided against pursuing the opportunity, and the opportunity is also available to the public.

   e. A Board member must not use his or her position with the University to solicit clients for the Board member’s business, or a business operated by a close friend, business associate, corporation, union, or partnership of the member, or a person to whom the member owes an obligation.

   f. Every Board member must avoid any situation in which there is, or may appear to be, a potential conflict of interest which could interfere with the member’s judgment in making decisions in the University’s best interest.

   g. There are several situations that could give rise to a conflict of interest. The most common are accepting gifts, favors, or kickbacks from suppliers, close or family relationships with outside suppliers, passing confidential information to competitors or other interested parties, or using privileged information inappropriately. Examples include:

      i. Influencing the University to lease equipment from a business owned by the Board member’s spouse.

      ii. Influencing the University to allocate funds to an institution where the Board member or his or her relative works or is involved.

      iii. Participating in a decision by the University to hire or promote a relative of the Board member.

      iv. Influencing the University to make all its travel arrangements through a travel agency owned by a relative of the Board member.

      v. Influencing or participating in a decision of the University that will directly or indirectly result in the Board member’s own financial gain.

   h. A Board member must fully disclose all circumstances that could conceivably be construed as a conflict of interest.

2. **DISCLOSURE**

   a. Full disclosure enables Board members to resolve unclear situations and gives an opportunity to dispose of conflicting interests before any difficulty can arise.

   b. A Board member must, within 24 hours of becoming aware of a potential conflict of interest situation, disclose the conflict in writing to the Board chair. This requirement exists even if the member does not become aware of the conflict until after a transaction is complete.

   c. If a Board member is in doubt about whether a situation involves a conflict, the member must immediately seek the advice of the Board chair. If appropriate, the board may wish to seek advice from the university’s legal counsel.

   d. Unless a Board member is otherwise directed, a member must immediately take steps to resolve the conflict or remove the suspicion that it exists.

   e. If a Board member is concerned that another Board member is in a conflict of interest situation, the member must immediately bring his or her concern to the other member’s attention and request that the conflict be declared. If the other member refuses to declare the conflict, the member must immediately bring his or her concern to the attention of the Board chair. If there is a concern with the Board chair, the issue should be referred to the Executive Committee.

   f. A Board member must disclose the nature and extent of any conflict at the first meeting of the Board after which the facts leading to the conflict have been brought to that member’s attention. After disclosing the conflict, the member must not be present during discussions or voting on the matter, regardless of whether the meeting is public or private, and must not attempt to influence the discussion or voting.

3. **OUTSIDE BUSINESS INTERESTS**

   a. Board members must declare possible conflicting outside business activities at the time of election or appointment. Notwithstanding any outside activities, Board members are required to act in the best interest of the University.

   b. No Board member should hold a significant financial interest, either directly or through a relative or associate, or hold or accept a position as an officer or director in an organization in a material relationship with the University, where by virtue of his or her position in the University, the member could in any way benefit the other organization by influencing the purchasing, selling, or other decisions of the University, unless that interest has been fully disclosed in writing to the University.

   c. A “significant financial interest” in this context is any interest substantial enough that decisions of the University could result in a personal gain for the Board member. For example, ownership of more than 5% of a company’s stock or receiving more than $10,000 in compensation from a company.

   d. Board members who have been selected to the board as a representative of a stakeholder group or region owe the same duties and loyalty to the University and when their duties conflict with the wishes of the stakeholder or constituent, their primary duty remains to act in the best interests of the University. In general, it is not considered a conflict of interest for a member of a broad group (i.e. students, employees, faculty) to vote on matters that will impact that group. However, conflict could reasonably be considered to exist for the following identified groups when considering these matters:

      i) Discussions and decisions directly affecting a specific instructional program in which:

         a. a student Board member is enrolled;

         b. faculty or employee Board members are employed; or

         c. the Board member has a related person enrolled or employed.

      ii) Discussions and decisions related to labor negotiations and labor relations:

         a. for faculty and employee Board members;

         b. for a Board member with a related person who holds a faculty or employee position at the University;

         c. for a Board member with a related person who holds a position at another institution who could be seen to gain or benefit from information divulged on these matters.

   e. For the purpose of clarification, these Bylaws intend that student members are permitted to vote on issues related to tuition and fees.

4. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**

   a. Confidential information includes proprietary technical, business, financial, legal, or any other information which the University treats as confidential (including all matters discussed at in-camera and committee meetings). Board members must not, either during or following their term as a Board member, disclose such information to any outside person unless authorized.

   b. Similarly, Board members must never disclose or use confidential information gained by virtue of their association with the University for personal gain, or to benefit friends, relatives, or associates.

   c. If in doubt about what is considered confidential, a Board member must seek guidance from the Board chair or the President.

5. **OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT OR ASSOCIATION**

   Board members who accept a position with any organization that could lead to a conflict of interest or situation prejudicial to the University’s interests must discuss the implications of accepting such a position with the Board chair, recognizing that acceptance of such a position might require the member’s resignation from the University’s board.

6. **ENTERTAINMENT, GIFTS, AND FAVORS**

   a. It is essential to fair business practices that all those who associate with the University, as suppliers, contractors, or directors, have access to the University on equal terms.

   b. Board members and members of their immediate families must not accept entertainment, gifts, or favors that create or appear to create a favored position for doing business with the organization. Any firm offering such inducements should be asked to cease.

   c. Similarly, no Board member should offer or solicit gifts or favors in order to secure preferential treatment for themselves or the University.

   d. Under no circumstances should Board members offer or receive cash, preferred loans, securities, or secret commissions in exchange for preferential treatment. Any Board member experiencing or witnessing such an offer must report the incident to the Board chair immediately.

   e. Gifts and entertainment should only be accepted or offered by a Board member in the normal exchanges common to established business relationships for the University, such as a business lunch or promotional items of nominal value. An exchange of such gifts should create no sense of obligation on the part of the Board member.

   f. Inappropriate gifts received by a Board member should be returned to the donor.

   g. Full and immediate disclosure to the Board chair of borderline cases will always be taken as good-faith compliance with these standards.

7. **USE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PROPERTY**

   Board members must require the University’s approval to use property owned by the University for personal purposes, or to purchase property from the University unless the purchase is made through the usual channels also available to the public. Even then, a Board member must not purchase property owned by the University if that Board member is involved in an official capacity in some aspect of the sale or purchase.

8. **BREACH**

   A Board member found to have breached his or her duty by violating the minimum standards set out in these Bylaws may, by resolution of the Board, be reprimanded, suspended, or be asked to resign from the Board. In severe cases, legal action may be pursued.

9. **ANNUAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT**

   All board members, staff members, and other key personnel must sign an annual disclosure statement affirming that they have read and understood the conflict of interest policy and have disclosed any potential conflicts.

10. **REVIEW PROCESS**

    Upon disclosure of a potential conflict of interest, the Board chair, in consultation with legal counsel if necessary, will review the situation and determine the appropriate course of action. The resolution of the conflict must be documented in the corporation’s records.

11. **RELATED TRANSACTIONS**

    Procedures for disclosing, addressing, and documenting related transactions must be followed to ensure transparency and accountability. All related transactions must be reviewed and approved by the Board to ensure they are conducted at arm’s length and in the best interest of the University."

**Procedure for Managing Conflicts of Interest**

1. **Define Conflict of Interest:**
   - The Board Member is responsible for defining what constitutes a conflict of interest. This involves identifying situations where board members may benefit personally from their position at the University.

2. **Disclose Conflict:**
   - If a Board Member identifies a potential conflict of interest, they must disclose it in writing to the Board Chair within 24 hours of becoming aware of the conflict. This disclosure should include all relevant details about the conflict.

3. **Review Conflict:**
   - The Board Chair, possibly in consultation with legal counsel, reviews the disclosed conflict of interest. The purpose of this review is to determine the appropriate action to address the conflict.

4. **Resolve Conflict:**
   - Based on the review outcome, the Board Member must take steps to resolve the conflict or remove any suspicion that it exists. This should be done as directed by the Board Chair.

5. **Document Resolution:**
   - The Board is responsible for ensuring that the existence and resolution of the conflict of interest are documented in the corporation’s records. This documentation is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability.

6. **Sign Annual Disclosure:**
   - All board members, staff members, and key personnel must sign an annual disclosure statement. This statement affirms their understanding of the conflict of interest policy and discloses any potential conflicts.

7. **Review Related Transactions:**
   - The Board must review and approve any related transactions to ensure they are conducted at arm’s length and in the best interest of the University. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity of the University's operations.

8. **Disciplinary Action (Conditional):**
   - If a breach of the conflict of interest policy is detected, the Board will take disciplinary action. This may include reprimanding, suspending, or asking the member to resign. In severe cases, legal action may be pursued to address the breach."
